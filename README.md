# üõ≥Ô∏è Titanic Survival Prediction - Logistic Regression

This repository contains my first attempt at solving the **Kaggle Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster** competition using **logistic regression**.

---

## üìñ Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using machine learning techniques, specifically **logistic regression**. This is a binary classification problem where the task is to predict whether a passenger survived (1) or did not survive (0) based on a variety of features such as age, fare, class, and other demographic factors.

## üìÇ Dataset

The dataset used in this project is provided by Kaggle and includes the following files:

- **train.csv**: The training set, containing passenger data with survival labels.
- **test.csv**: The test set, containing passenger data without survival labels.
- **gender_submission.csv**: A sample submission file in the correct format for Kaggle submissions.

You can download the dataset from the official Kaggle competition page: [Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)

## üöÄ Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/titanic-survival-prediction.git
   cd titanic-survival-prediction
   ```

2. **Install the Required Packages**  
   Install the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.

3. **Run Jupyter Notebooks**  
   Explore the data and the model development process by running the provided Jupyter notebooks:
   - `Approach1.ipynb`: Initial data exploration and logistic regression model.
   - `Approach2.ipynb`: Second attempt with potential improvements.

4. **Train and Test the Model**  
   Execute the main script or notebooks to train the logistic regression model on the training set and generate predictions for the test set.

## üìä Model Performance

In this first attempt, the logistic regression model achieved an accuracy of **31%** on the test set. This performance is below the baseline accuracy of always predicting the majority class, indicating that significant improvements are necessary.

## üîß Future Improvements

The current model performance leaves room for a lot of improvement. Some potential areas to explore:

1. **Feature Engineering**  
   Creating new features or transforming existing ones to make the data more predictive.
   
2. **Try Other Algorithms**  
   Experimenting with more sophisticated machine learning algorithms like:
   - **Random Forest**
   - **Gradient Boosting**
   
3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**  
   Optimizing the model using techniques like Grid Search or Random Search to fine-tune hyperparameters and improve performance.
