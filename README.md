Titanic Survival Prediction - Logistic Regression

This repository contains my first attempt at solving the Kaggle Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster competition using logistic regression.
Project Overview
The goal of this project is to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using machine learning techniques, specifically logistic regression. This is a binary classification problem where we predict whether a passenger survived (1) or not (0) based on various features.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project is provided by Kaggle and includes the following files:

train.csv: The training set
test.csv: The test set
gender_submission.csv: A sample submission file in the correct format

Requirements
To run this project, you'll need:

Python 3.x
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib (for visualizations)

You can install the required packages using:
 pip install -r requirements.txt

 Usage

Clone this repository
Install the required packages
Run the Jupyter notebooks to see the data exploration and model development process
Execute the main script to train the model and generate predictions.

Model Performance
In this first attempt, our logistic regression model achieved an accuracy of 0.31 (31%) on the test set. This performance is below the baseline accuracy of always predicting the majority class, indicating that there's significant room for improvement.

Future Improvements

Feature engineering to create more predictive variables
Trying other algorithms such as Random Forest or Gradient Boosting
Hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model
